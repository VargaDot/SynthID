# SynthID
### Work in progress

SynthID is an attempt at replicating [Shadows of doubt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/986130/Shadows_of_Doubt/)'s random/procedural [identity](https://shadows-of-doubt.fandom.com/wiki/Citizen_Profile) generation, my aim is to create a flexible, easy to use library/framework that can be integrated into any project seamlessly.

Other works used in the repository:
